Instructions
Please implement a command-line application that takes a path to a file as an argument and prints a word count of its contents. The word count should consist of a word with a number of its occurrences in the file per line and should be sorted by the number of occurrences starting with the most frequent word. The results should be consistent between two files which contain the exact same words in the same frequency but in a different order. Please provide the solution in an archive together with instructions on how to build it and run it.
Considerations:
If you believe that the instructions are not precise and you need to make some assumptions please do so but make them clear to us by including them in the instructions sent as part of your solution. If you are uneasy about something and would rather ask a question than make an assumption then you can always get in touch.
The task is simple on purpose - we're sure that apart from applying for this position you still have other things to do in life, like your current job for example therefore we don't want to ask you to spend unnecessarily long time on solving complex problems. We are on the other hand interested in seeing what you consider best software engineering practices so please ensure that your solution could be considered "production ready" and complete.
You are free to choose the tools and language for your solution as long as they are JVM based. Note that we extensively use Groovy and would therefore like to see that you are comfortable working with code that is written at least partially in a functional style, e.g. using Java lambda expressions.
